## What's this?
These are demos I created while playing around with Javidx9's PixelGameEngine.

### Gravity Simulation
In this Demo I have included a gravity simulation between objects, using classical physics. You can try it out and play around, press I to switch to insert mode where you can create objects of various masses, then press the left mouse button and drag the mouse to give the object some velocity.
I've also included with camera and scaling (zooming), move with WASD; and zoom with Q and E.
